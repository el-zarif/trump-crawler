He's also the co-host of the \"Politics & Polls\" podcast. Follow him @julianzelizer . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) President Donald Trump walks away from a turbulent week with a major political victory in the form of a massive deal that raises military and domestic spending caps by $300 billion, giving both parties many items that they have been looking for, and raising the debt ceiling until March 2019.\n\nIt followed a wild spell for the stock market that left investors rattled and a brewing scandal over White House chief of staff John Kelly's decision to keep Rob Porter, who has since resigned, on the job despite serious accusations of spousal abuse.\n\nGetting this bill done is a huge step for President Trump. He can claim to have achieved bipartisan support around the budget, an issue that has tied up Washington for years. And now Democrats enter into the final round of the legislative negotiations this month over immigration with almost no leverage at all.\n\nTaking the spending threat off the table is extremely important. Democrats, who are the minority in the House and Senate, don't really have that many tools at their disposal that they can use in trying to stop the Republicans from moving forward with their agenda. Right now, President Trump controls the show.\n\nAs congressional Republicans showed under President Barack Obama, spending is one of the only areas where the minority can tie up deliberations to the point that presidents are forced to negotiate with them. With the budget debate resolved for the near future, including a two-year agreement on the debt ceiling, Democrats are left with virtually no muscle, at least until the midterm elections.\n\nTrump will now be able to boast about the one thing that doesn't take place often in the town of Washington: bipartisanship. With this budget deal, President Trump demonstrated that he can go up against the Freedom Caucus that controls the House, walk away with a victory even when they oppose him and also win over Democratic support. Seventy-three Democrats voted in favor of the bill in the House, while in the Senate, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer worked in cooperative fashion with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to get this done.\n\nDespite the nativism, the racism, the xenophobia, sexism and simply un-presidential behavior that has come out of this White House, a significant number of Democrats are still willing to vote for a deal and to work with the President. Both parties will exit this battle with a greater sense of fear about what President Trump can accomplish on the Hill. This will weaken his opposition.\n\nAlthough 67 House Republicans voted against the bill, overall Republican support for the President remains strong. The Republicans have accepted that President Trump is the titular head of their party and most will work with him to get bills done. Some of the votes against the spending bill from Freedom Caucus Republicans surely were cast in the context of their knowing that Democratic votes would push this through anyway.\n\nThe next item on the agenda is immigration, and here, President Trump really has the potential to control the terms of the debate. Democrats enter into this debate in a terrible fix. The President will put on the table an extremely difficult choice.\n\nIf Democrats want to reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, and protect the Dreamers from being deported, they need to agree to an extraordinarily restrictive and reactionary set of policies that will close the borders to millions of others and end the liberalized immigration policies that the nation has had on the books since 1965.\n\nGone is the hope to achieve the kind of grand bargain on immigration -- which would have provided a path to citizenship for millions living here without authorization and with uncertain futures -- that Presidents George W. Bush and Obama had hoped to achieve.\n\nNow, Democrats may have to settle for the reinstatement of DACA in exchange for giving right-wing, hard-line Republicans almost everything else they want. Even if some conservatives say no to DACA, the budget bill shows how Trump can build a coalition without them.\n\nWithout being able to threaten the administration on the budget, the only real threat that Democrats now possess is to kill an immigration deal that includes DACA. The problem is that President Trump can live with that; they can't.\n\nA trifecta of legislative victories -- the tax cut, the budget deal and potentially an immigration deal -- would give President Trump a set of big talking points as he starts to get ready for 2020. It is unclear whether any of this will help the GOP in the midterm elections, where there is still considerable evidence of losses for the party, as to be expected in midterms, but for his presidency, the achievements are starting to add up.\n\nMore than the corporate tax cut, which was low-hanging fruit for a Republican government, the budget deal is the kind of legislation that any president would be happy about. And Democrats should remember that even if they take control of Congress in 2018, Trump can end up using the Congress as a foil to build his own support, just as President Bill Clinton did with the GOP after 1994.\n\nDoes this mean the dysfunction of Washington is over? Not at all. Does this mean that bipartisan love is going to break out on Capitol Hill? That is as likely as the Easter Bunny suddenly showing up in the House chamber.\n\nIs President Trump going to abandon all the ideas and practices that have polarized, divided and dismayed large parts of the electorate? No. The real Donald Trump is never going away.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe President still faces many political challenges. The swings of the stock market are a reminder that the underlying economy can be volatile, as can the strength Trump gains from good economic news.\n\nNor will Trump be able to avoid doing and saying things that alienate and anger much of the population that still does not like him. And even as he creates confusion and doubts about the credibility of the Russia investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller is a formidable prosecutor who might potentially produce a damning report about the Trump campaign and this administration.\n\nStill, the budget deal is further proof that the politics of this presidency have shifted. It is striking evidence that Trump is on much stronger ground and gaining a better feel for how to achieve victories that leave his opponents kicking and screaming without having much else they can do to stop him.", "title": "A big victory for Trump"},

He trumpeted the large package of tax cuts he signed into law last year and proclaimed that a regulatory rollback has allowed industries to thrive. And he staged several emotional moments with invited guests sitting in the first lady's box, including the parents of Otto Warmbier, who died after being returned to the United States by his North Korean captors.\n\nThe evening began with a precedent-breaking move by Melania Trump: instead of riding to the Capitol with her husband, the first lady arrived to the building early to meet privately with her invited guests.\n\nAnd while Trump offered the traditional assessment of American strength -- \"the state of our union is strong because our people are strong\" -- Trump did little to acknowledge that his presidency has been decidedly nontraditional. He climbed the dais in the Capitol with one of the lowest approval ratings for any first-term president. His presidency continues to be clouded by investigations into his campaign's ties to Russia.\n\nTrump sought to look past those facts and toward a future marked by unity and inclusion.\n\n\"This, in fact, is our new American moment,\" Trump said in his remarks, which rarely strayed from the prepared text loaded into his teleprompter. \"There has never been a better time to start living the American dream.\"\n\nCan optimism last?\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump outlines pillars of immigration plan Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump outlines pillars of immigration plan 03:27\n\nThe moments of soaring optimism from the President stood in stark contrast to the message he often delivers on Twitter. It remained an open question how long the applause, which echoed in the House chamber, would linger, given the hard edges surrounding many of his policies.\n\nOnly a month after his first address to a joint session of Congress a year ago, Trump accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping his conversations, a sign that behavior cannot be judged on one speech or one evening alone.\n\nTuesday's speech, laced with American stories of triumph and tragedy, did not mask the President's priorities or how he views issues like immigration. Even while pledging to extend \"an open hand to work with members of both parties,\" Trump made clear his hard-line on immigration would take precedent over the \"bill of love\" that he mentioned earlier this month. And he devoted more time to MS-13 gang violence than he did to telling the stories of successful immigrants who have thrived in America.\n\n\"My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans -- to protect their safety, their families, their communities and their right to the American Dream,\" Trump said as he outlined a plan that would allow up to 1.8 million undocumented immigrants to remain in the country while funding a border wall, ending the visa lottery system and reforming family immigration rules.\n\nBut he was booed by Democrats when he used the fraught term \"chain migration,\" and he laid bare the nationalist undertones of his policy by declaring \"Americans are dreamers, too.\"\n\nThe remarks seemed unlikely to produce agreement between Republicans and Democrats, who will have to come together in some form to pass an immigration law. He didn't offer a pathway -- or even a head start -- toward solving the immigration impasse for the \"Dreamers,\" which Democrats have insisted must be tied to a long-term government funding bill.\n\nTrump also did not avoid oblique references to the divisive topics that have salted his first year in office, including the controversy over football players kneeling during the National Anthem.\n\nSaluting a 12-year-old guest who spearheaded an effort to place flags on veterans' gravestones, Trump said the student's actions reminded all Americans of their \"civic duty.\"\n\n\"Preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the National Anthem,\" he said, to applause from Republican lawmakers in the crowd.\n\nHighest-profile platform\n\nA president's State of the Union is typically his highest-profile platform of the year, and viewership is generally higher in the first part of a presidency. But television ratings for the speech have steadily fallen over the decades, and Trump has shown a penchant for bypassing traditional communication channels in favor of social media.\n\nIf the State of the Union has assumed a reduced importance, however, there were no signs the White House took it any less seriously. For months, Trump fed handwritten notes with lines for the speech to his team of speechwriters, a White House official said.\n\nIn his speech, Trump called on lawmakers to approve a $1.5 trillion infrastructure package and touted his work on health care and in naming a new justice to the US Supreme Court.\n\nTrump spoke most extensively about domestic affairs, but did reserve the final section of his address for foreign matters. He touted successes in battling back ISIS and again denounced the Iran nuclear deal. And he warned that North Korea could \"very soon\" be capable of threatening the US homeland with nuclear weapons.\n\n\"Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation,\" Trump said of North Korea. \"I will not repeat the mistakes of the past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.\"\n\nTrump practiced delivering the address from the Map Room on Monday, the official said. Trump's predecessors also rehearsed their addresses from a mock podium and teleprompter set up in the White House basement room.\n\nA team of speechwriters and top policy aides helped Trump craft his address, White House officials said. They included National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and staff secretary Rob Porter.\n\nTrump first reviewed a draft of his State of the Union address in December, and has made handwritten edits in recent days with black felt tip pens. In the last several weeks, Trump has workshopped ideas for the speech or edited certain sections while in the residence at night, handing over his changes to staffers the next day.\n\n'United'\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN fact-checks Trump around the world Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN fact-checks Trump around the world 02:31\n\nDemocrats selected Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, to deliver the traditional response to the President's speech.\n\n\"Bullies may land a punch. They might leave a mark,\" the lawmaker said before a live audience gathered at a Fall River, Massachusetts, technical school. \"But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future.\"\n\nA number of other responses were also planned, including by Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who ran for President in 2016. A number of Democrats boycotted the speech.\n\nAbove the House floor, the administration's hosted guests in the first lady's box meant to illustrate policy objectives.

But the Wall Street Journal reported Trump's attorney Michael Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to keep it covered up.
